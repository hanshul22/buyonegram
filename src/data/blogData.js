    description: "Meet Mahendra Singh Saran, the founder of Buy One Gram Private Limited. The platform directly connects farmers with agro-buyers to ensure fair prices and eliminate middlemen, helping them sell their produce directly to buyers in the agro-industry, boosting income and transparency in the supply chain. Mahendra completed a 14-week Liftoff Program by the Wadhwani Foundation, gaining practical skills in pitching, finance, marketing, and future planningâ€”helping him scale his business effectively. He highlights that many farmers struggle due to limited education and urges for better training to help them thrive in modern markets. Mahendra thanks the Wadhwani Foundation and I Am Punjab for their support, calling the program a turning point in his entrepreneurial journey.",

    description: "The founder of Buy One Gram expresses deep gratitude towards Geeta, the Star 2.0 program, and the SP JMR team for organizing a one-on-one mentoring and pitching session. Coming from a village 120 kilometers from Jaipur, they feel extremely excited about receiving the third prize and are motivated to work more closely with farmers. Since 2020, they've been running their startup, focusing on understanding and addressing real problems faced by farmers in villages despite government efforts. Their approach involves living in villages to gain firsthand knowledge before seeking funding. The recent session with around 50 investors at SP JMR provided valuable learning opportunities, reinforcing their commitment to solving rural challenges while staying connected to their roots.",
